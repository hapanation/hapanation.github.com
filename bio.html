    <p>Despite being born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, I grew up with a desire to learn about the world around me.  Lucky enough to have a family that valued outdoor experiences, I have spent over a year of my life living without a cieling.  My goals for the future are to do no harm, an increasingly difficult task in the world we live in with little to no understanding of the global effects of our actions. I am a visual learner and do much better in classes which lend themselves to diagrams, drawings, and graphs.  Sometimes I color, sometimes I paint, sometimes I sleep in.</p>
